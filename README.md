### Summary

This was a project I did during my Masters of Software Development.   
This project was an encryption app that allows the user to encrypt and decrypt messages using AES, DES, and the Affine Cipher.

### Running Notes

Need to delete default build file when starting new javafx project.

Need to remove default javafx from build path. Need to add the proper javafx to module path in build path.

Need to add run configuration VM argument --module-path ||Insert path to javafx lib here||

Need to install a local web host and load encryptUsers.sql as a database onto that web host.
